# ChickenDiseasePrediction
The project involves collecting and analysing data from public dataset. Machine learning algorithms are then used to analyse the data and make predictions about the likelihood of a disease outbreak. This project is based on improving the existing code.

IMPROVEMENT MADE IN THE CODE:

Ensemble is a technique in machine learning where two or more models are trained and combined to improve the overall performance and accuracy of the system.
In this we have trained three pre-trained models “EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetV2S, ResNet50V2” on the same dataset.
